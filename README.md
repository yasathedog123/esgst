## Installation

There are two different ways to use ESGST: extension or userscript. You can choose which one you want to use, but the extension is a lot faster and has a better peformance than the userscript, so I recommend it, although there is no major difference between them, except for a few options that are only available in the extension because of limitations in the userscript.

$${\color{yellow}Caution:}$$ The provided extensions are unsigned, please be aware of the [risks](https://www.google.com/search?q=risks+of+using+an+unsigned+extension) of using unsigned extensions.

### Option 1 - Extension

It should be possible to install the extension in any Chromium-based browser from the Chrome store (such as Opera, Vivaldi, etc...), any Firefox-based browser from the Firefox store (such as Waterfox, etc...), and any browser that uses the Phoebus system from the Pale Moon store (such as Basilik, etc...).

You can also use the extension on Android through Firefox for Android, but some features might not work or not be optimized enough for mobile.

Chrome: 

- Go to the Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
- Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to it
- Click the Load unpacked button
- Select the directory you extracted the downloaded zip to.

Firefox : Only [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/), [Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/all/), and [ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/). accept unsigned extensions.
- Type `about:config` into the URL bar.
- Set `extensions.webextensions.keepStorageOnUninstall` to `true`.
- Set `extensions.webextensions.keepUuidOnUninstall` to `true`.
- Set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`
- Go to the Extensions page (`about:addons`).
- Select `Add-on From File` from the settings cog and select the downloaded zip.

Palemoon:

- Go to the Extensions page (`about:addons`).
- Select `Add-on From File` from the settings cog and select the downloaded xpi.

### Option 2 - Userscript

To install the userscript, you must install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or some other userscript manager first. Then [click here](https://github.com/yasathedog123/esgst/releases/latest/download/userscript.user.js) and you should be prompted to install it. I recommend Tampermonkey, because the userscript uses the GM_addValueChangeListener API to communicate changes in the storage between tabs, and that API is not available on Greasemonkey, so a polyfill is used for Greasemonkey, which is not very effective and can affect the performance.

You can also use the userscript on Android through Firefox with Violentmonkey or USI, but some features might not work or not be optimized enough for mobile.

- All requests from 'Whitelist/Blacklist Checker', 'Not Activated/Multiple Win Checker', 'Not Received Finder' and 'Archive Searcher' are limited to 2 per second, to prevent a stress on the SteamGifts servers.
- If you try to leave the page while 'Whitelist/Blacklist Checker', 'Not Activated/Multiple Win Checker', 'Not Received Finder' and 'Archive Searcher' are running, you will get a confirmation dialog asking you if you want to leave the page. Additionally, while these features are running, their buttons are faded out.
